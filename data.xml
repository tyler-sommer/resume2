    <profile>
        <section>Born and raised in the suburbs outside Salt Lake City, Utah, I got my first computer around 1998 when I was just ten years old. It was a beige Windows 95 machine and it opened doors to someplace magical.</section>
        <section>During Christmas one year shortly after, I received my own copy of Microsoft Frontpage 2000. I recall building many terrible, terrible websites dedicated to Pok√©mon and Dragonball Z. Meager beginnings to what would become a successful career in problem solving.</section>
        <section>I landed my first professional coding gig in 2008, integrating landing pages with CRMs and CRMs with payment processors. Eight years later, and I now help build infrastructure to manage the storing and processing of huge amounts of data for aggregation into meaningful reports.</section>
        <section>Computing is a major passion of mine. I'm intrigued by all the wonderful impossibilities that become possible with a little bit of code. These days, I spend most of my time learning how to be a dad. Otherwise you'll find me coding, tinkering, and learning new things... or watching Rick and Morty.</section>
