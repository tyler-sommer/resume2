    <profile>
        <section>Born and raised in the suburbs outside Salt Lake City, Utah, I got my first computer around 1998 when I was just ten years old. It was a beige Windows 95 machine and it opened doors to someplace magical.</section>
        <section>A year or so later, I received my own copy of Microsoft Frontpage 2000 as a gift. I recall building many terrible, terrible websites dedicated to Pok√©mon and Dragonball Z. Meager beginnings to what would become a successful career in software engineering.</section>
        <section>I landed my first professional coding gig in 2008, integrating landing pages with CRMs and CRMs with payment processors. Then, building a payment processor itself. A decade later and I'm building resilient, distributed systems that operate on a global scale.</section>
        <section>Computing is a major passion of mine. I am constantly fascinated by all aspects of software engineering. I'm always in search of knowledge and application. These days, I spend most of my time learning how to be a dad. Otherwise, you'll find me coding, tinkering, and learning new things... or watching Star Trek.</section>
